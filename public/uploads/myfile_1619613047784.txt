 I bow my head to almighty god who gave us strength and wisdom due to which we have been able to express our views and research. A work of this nature can never be done by any person alone. This project is an acknowledgement to the intensity, drive and technical competence of many individuals who have contributed to it. No endeavour can successfully accomplish without any active participation, sincere assistance and encouraging inspiration of others. Cooperation, support, advice and guidance of many people who have brought this dissertation in this present shape. The special thanks go to my helpful supervisor Mr MukeshJamwal(java trainer, Grapess Solutions Pvt Ltd. Yamuna Nagar). The supervision and support that he gave truly help the progression and smoothness of the progression of the internship program. The cooperation is much indeed appreciated. My grateful thanks also go to my team members. We work together to provide success environment to the project. A big contribution and hardwork from the team during 45 days is very great indeed. All projects during the program would be nothing without the enthusiasm of the team. Besides this, the internship program makes me realise the importance of working together as a team and as a new experience in working environment which challenges us every minute. My sincere thanks go to our respected HOD for support. I would like to thank all the staff of the institute who provided the best of their knowledge and give us newer and better ideas, whenever required and requested for. I offer appreciation to my parents and all our friends for their ever willing cooperation and moral support. MOHIT KAUL 1811341 CSE-4th yr.
